This is a social media app for pets and animal lovers, alike. Users create profiles and upload posts all about their pets, including a photo and caption. Other users can like posts, including their own if they so please. They could also delete posts they've created (but why would they do that?!). Posts populate in a feed of all posts, organized by post timing.
